          You can cancel a paid order <strong>{cancellation.window}</strong>. Once a consignment has been handed to the
          carrier it can no longer be cancelled, because pesticide consignments cannot be recalled or re-routed in transit.

          Online self-service cancellation is not available yet; the helpline is the fastest route. If the order has
          already been dispatched, you may refuse delivery, in which case it is treated as a returned delivery under our{" "}

          reaches us intact.

        Individual items can be removed from an order before dispatch. The refund for removed items is processed the same

        cancellation changes the shipping weight class.
