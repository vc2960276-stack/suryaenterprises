            Orders are processed only after the payment is confirmed as successful. Orders are typically dispatched within{" "}
            <strong>{shipping.dispatchWindow}</strong> of payment confirmation, excluding Sundays and public holidays.

          <li>
            Transit time depends on the destination and the carrier. Because pesticide consignments move by surface
            transport, delivery to distant or remote locations takes longer than for ordinary parcels.
          </li>
          <li>We do not promise delivery dates on the Marketplace. Once dispatched, we share the carrier and consignment details by SMS or email so you can follow the shipment.</li>
